# Allegro-txt2vid-pinokio
A Pinokio Install Script for the [Rhymes Allegro](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Allegro) text-to-video model.

## Sources
* Installs a Pinokio fork: https://github.com/ai-anchorite/Allegro-txt2vid
* Gradio UI and associated code borrowed from: https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/allegro-text2video

## Important Notes
* Takes an hour to generate a result. 1 hour. hopefully will be optimized, but yeah. 1 hour (on a 3090). 
* My GPU warms me at night. 
* 12GB VRAM is sufficient though. (1 hour. txt2video so mostly luck as to what you get at the end).
* I can't stop clicking the go button..

*Note: This is a throwaway preview build based on Rhymes' original code (tested on H100s).*
